# Data Cleaning and Transformation Project: FIFA 21 Players Dataset

Welcome to my Data Cleaning and Transformation project involving the FIFA 21 players dataset! In this project, I tackled the challenge of cleaning and transforming a messy dataset containing information about FIFA 21 players.

## Project Overview

**Objective:** The main goal of this project was to prepare the FIFA 21 players dataset for analysis by performing comprehensive data cleaning and transformation tasks. The dataset contained various data quality issues, inconsistencies, and missing values that needed to be addressed.

**Tools Used:** For this project, I utilized Python's pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy and CountryConverter libraries for data manipulation, transformation and visualization. Jupyter Notebook was used to document the entire process, providing a clear record of the steps taken.

## Steps Taken

1. **Data Inspection:** I began by loading the dataset and performing an initial inspection to understand its structure, contents, and data quality issues.

2. **Checking for Missing Values:** I checked to see if there are missing values so I can handle them and ensure the dataset was as complete as possible.

3. **Data Transformation:** I altered a values of the data to make it suitable for analysis or modeling.

4. **Data Type Conversion:** I converted data types where needed, ensuring that each variable had the appropriate data type for analysis.

7. **Feature Engineering:** I created new features from existing ones to enhance the dataset's utility, making it more suitable for analysis.

8. **Data Visualization:** I used data visualization techniques to gain insights into the data after the cleaning and transformation process.

## Project Outcome

Through careful data cleaning and transformation, I successfully transformed the messy FIFA 21 players dataset into a structured, clean, and usable format. The project enabled me to demonstrate my skills in data manipulation, problem-solving, and data quality enhancement.

## Future Steps

While the dataset is now cleaned and transformed, there are opportunities for further analysis and insights. Potential future steps include exploring player performance trends, building predictive models, or integrating external data sources for richer analysis.
