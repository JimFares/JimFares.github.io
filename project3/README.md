# College Football Outcome Prediction

## Project Overview

Welcome to the College Football Outcome Prediction project! The primary objective of this project is to leverage historical data from college football games (NCAA) to develop a predictive model. The goal is to create a system that can accurately forecast the results of future college football games, i.e. predicting the point spread. This predictive capability has the potential to inform profitable wagering decisions, specifically those related to the spread. This project represents the collaborative efforts of a team of individuals passionate about sports and data analytics.

**Note:** As this project involves proprietary models, the code for the optimization model itself will not be shared in this repository to maintain confidentiality and competitive advantage.

## Repository Structure

In this repository, you will find:

1. **Data:** This folder contains a dataset pertaining the 2016, 2017 and 2018 NCAA season used for training and testing the prediction model, as well as the 2019 season dataset used to test the model even further. These datasets include historical college football game data, which serves as the foundation for our predictive analysis and provide to us a better understanding of how well our model really is.

2. **Code:** While the specific model implementation is kept confidential, you will find code snippets and scripts related to data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation, and model tuning. This repository provides insights into parts of the data science pipeline and methodology used to create the predictive model.

3. **Results:** Within this folder, you will discover summary reports, charts, and insights derived from the model's predictions. These results help us assess the model's accuracy and its potential for profitable outcomes.

4. **Documentation:** Detailed documentation and explanations of the project's objectives, methodologies, and findings can be found here. This section provides transparency about the project's approach and outcomes.


## Contribution and Collaboration

This project was a collaborative effort, and we believe in the power of open collaboration and data-driven insights. While we cannot share the specific model details, we welcome discussions, questions, and collaborations related to college football prediction and data analysis.
