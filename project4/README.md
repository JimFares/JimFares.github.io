# Sakila SQL Data Analysis Projects

This repository contains a series of SQL data analysis projects based on the Sakila sample database. Each project focuses on different SQL queries and tasks to demonstrate data analysis skills using SQL.

## Project List

1. **List of Customers Renting Action Films:**
   - Description: Retrieve customer information (first name, last name, email) for customers who have rented action films.
   - SQL Query: [customers_renting_action_films.sql](customers_renting_action_films.sql)

2. **Average Rental Duration and Total Rentals per Customer:**
   - Description: Calculate the total number of rentals and the average rental duration for each customer.
   - SQL Query: [total_num_rentals_and_avg_rental_duruation.sql](total_num_rentals_and_avg_rental_duruation.sql)

3. **Total Revenue per Film**
   - Description: Calculate the total revenue generated by each film by summing the payment amounts from rentals.
   - SQL Query: [total_revenue_per_film.sql](total_revenue_per_film.sql)

4. **Films with Rental Rates Higher Than Average**
   - Description: Select films with rental rates higher than the average rental rate across all films.
   - SQL Query: [rental_higher_than_avg.sql](rental_higher_than_avg.sql)

5. **Average Rental Duration for Films in a Specific Category**
   - Description: Calculates the average rental duration for films in a specific category (category_id = 5).
   - SQL Query: [avg_rental_duration_for_category_5.sql](avg_rental_duration_for_category_5.sql)
  
6. **Calculate Total Payment Amount per Customer (Ordered by Total Amount, Descending)**
   - Description: Calculate the total payment amount made by each customer and orders the results by the total amount in descending order.
   - SQL Query: [total_pay_per customer.sql](total_pay_per customer.sql)
  
7. **Top 5 Films with the Highest Inventory Counts**
   - Description: List the top 5 films with the highest inventory counts.
   - SQL Query: [top_5_films_w_highest_inv.sql](top_5_films_w_highest_inv.sql)
  
8. **Calculate Average Replacement Cost of Films**
   - Description: Calculate the average replacement cost of films in the database.
   - SQL Query: [avg_replacement_cost.sql](avg_replacement_cost.sql)
  
9. **Count Films per Category with Category Names**
   - Description: Count the number of films in each film category and provides the count along with category names.
   - SQL Query: [count_films_per_category.sql](count_films_per_category.sql)
     
10. **Calculate Average Payment Amount on Sundays**
   - Description: Calculate the average payment amount on Sundays for rentals.
   - SQL Query: [avg_pay_amt_on_sunday.sql](avg_pay_amt_on_sunday.sql)
     
11. **Count Total Rentals per Customer**
   - Description: Count the total number of rentals made by each customer.
   - SQL Query: [total_num_rentals_per_customer.sql](total_num_rentals_per_customer.sql)
     
12. **Calculate Total Rentals by Year**
   - Description: Calculate the total number of rentals for each year, extracting the year from the rental date.
   - SQL Query: [total_num_rentals_per_year.sql](total_num_rentals_per_year.sql)

## Getting Started

To run these SQL queries on your own Sakila database, follow these steps:

1. Download and install the Sakila sample database from [Sakila DB](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/).

2. Create a database and import the Sakila database schema and data.

3. Use your preferred SQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench) to connect to your Sakila database.

4. Copy and paste the SQL queries from the project files into your SQL client and execute them.
